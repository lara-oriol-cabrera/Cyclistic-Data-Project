## Introduction 
The Cyclistic Project revolves around a fictional bike-sharing company called Cyclistic, created for one of the final capstone projects in Coursera.<br/>
Cyclistic operates a bike rental service offering both casual and annual memberships. <br/>
The company is facing a challenge: a large portion of their users are casual riders, and they are seeking ways to convert these casual users into annual members to increase retention and profitability.<br/>

The main objective of this analysis was to identify patterns in user behavior, understand how casual users interact with the service compared to members, and ultimately provide recommendations on how to convert casual riders into annual members.<br/>

To achieve this, I conducted data cleaning and preparation, analyzed key metrics, created data visualizations, and proposed strategic recommendations for the company.

## Project Structure 
This project is organized into two main folders: 

1. Presentation Folder: This folder contains a step-by-step presentation explaining the problem, methodology, and the process followed to solve the main questions Cyclistic had. <br/>
It provides clear visualizations and insights drawn from the data. 

2. Data Analysis Folder: This folder contains the detailed analysis. 
Inside, you can find:<br/> 

a) Database 🗄️ -> The raw and cleaned datasets used for analysis. *(Please view raw data to download and open the Excel file)* <br/>

b) Excel Analysis 📊 -> Files containing the cleaned data, pivot tables, and the data visualizations used. *(Please view raw data to download and open the Excel files)* <br/>
